Objective
Create a comprehensive AI-powered compliance application that enables businesses to create, store, sign, verify, and maintain chain of custody for compliance documents. The application should streamline regulatory compliance processes while ensuring document integrity and auditability.
Context
This application will be used by compliance officers and employees at organizations that must adhere to strict regulatory requirements across various industries. Users will have varying levels of technical expertise but need a straightforward system to manage compliance documentation. The application should reduce compliance-related administrative burdens while maintaining security and legal validity of all documents.
Instructions

Develop a modern single-page application using Vite, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS for the frontend
Implement a secure document storage system using Replit's built-in database
Create the following core features:

User authentication with role-based access control (admin, compliance officer, employee)
AI-assisted document generation with customizable templates for different compliance requirements
Digital signature system with verification mechanisms
Document versioning and change tracking
Chain of custody logging for audit trails
Automated compliance reminders and deadline tracking
Dashboard with compliance status overview and upcoming requirements
Search functionality across all stored documents


Use a clean, professional design with accessibility features
Implement proper error handling and validation throughout
Structure the codebase for maintainability with clear separation of concerns

Constraints

Use only Vite, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and Replit's built-in database
Ensure the application works within Replit's environment constraints
Implement proper security measures for sensitive compliance data
The application should work efficiently with up to 500 documents and 50 concurrent users
Avoid using external APIs that might introduce regulatory compliance issues
Ensure all features work in modern browsers without requiring additional plugins

Desired Output
A fully functional compliance application with:

Complete source code with TypeScript type definitions
User authentication system with role-based permissions
Document management system with versioning
Digital signature functionality with verification
Comprehensive audit trail and chain of custody tracking
Clean, responsive UI built with TailwindCSS
Basic documentation for setup and usage
Sample compliance document templates for testing
